## Inspiration

One of the biggest problems among students is finding an internship or job opportunity. The goal of our app is to help students and fresh graduates finding their internship or job opportunity. We called our app Intern Xplorer.

## What it does

Some of the features our app provides are:

- job posts
- search and filtering
- interview preparation resources - links and files that can be useful for the interview preparation

At this moment the app is centralized which means we have an authentication and authorization mechanism that allows an admin user to manipulate job posts (create, update and delete them). Everyone is able to see and search through those internship posts. The other thing which is partially implemented is related to interviewing resources. In this app, the admin can post some useful resources (links and files) which can be used during interview preparation.

## How we built it

This app is implemented as a REST API app that communicates with the UI. The stack we used:<br>

## Challenges we ran into

We had to adapt to different stack changes, time management issues, and time zone differences.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We created a useful app that can be used by MLH fellows and complete community for the internship and job search. Our goal is to continue working on this app and create a useful and assistive app in student's mission of internship/open-source/job searching.

## What we learned

We've learned or deepened our web frameworks knowledge and how to work as a team.

## What's next for Intern Xplorer

Integrate features we didn't manage to finish for the hackathon. Continue working on other features. We have so many ideas, but so little time.
